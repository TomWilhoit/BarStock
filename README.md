# BarStock

## Project Description

BarStock is an app that makes it easier for bar owners to place orders from their distributors. A user can log into the app and  browse a distributor's products by type (beer or liquor) and category (whiskey, vodka, pilsner, etc). When the user makes changes to his or her shopping cart, the totals bar displays the overall cost of the order as well as a projected profit based on the menu and pricing at the user's bar. Finally, the user checks out and submits the order to the distributor.
